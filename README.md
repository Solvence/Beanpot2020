How we came up with the ides:
After a lot of brainstorming (and games of Scribble), we decided that the UX for a well known instagram page for Northeastern students called 'NEUgigs' was just not cutting it. After viewing the poorly monitered and very basic instagram page, we concluded that a larger audience (Boston students) would create a better ecommerce platform, in addition to having it in an official app format.

Challenges:
Initially we were creating the app on two platforms, Swift and Android studios, but since 2/6 people have MacBooks, we decided that it was too difficult to continue with two separate projects.

Another big challenge we faced was the lack of Android Studios experience. None of us have made an app of Android Studios and yet we created one by learning the documentation along the way.
